1. Introduction

   HATE is a (B)Ash based Templating Engine library, inspired a little
   bit in Django's template engine, created to work with Web pages in
   embedded devices running busybox and using the Ash shell (normally
   all routers running linux kernels use this configuration).
   
   HATE was specially born to make the Nightwing's[0] Web Interface
   code cleaner ([b]ash is as powerful as ugly).

   HATE is compatible with Bash so virtually you could use it to
   whatever you want, the only requirement is your shell to be Bash or
   Ash.

2. Requirements

   You don't need anything special, just a Bash or Ash shell.

3. Installation

   Just put it whatever you want and then call it inside your
   "controller" file like this:

   . /path/to/hate

4. Usage

   Once you add the ". /path/to/hate" line in your bash file you have
   available several template tags. You can see an extensive example
   of what's available in the tests folder and of course in the code.

5. Bug Reports

   If you find a bug please report it sending an email listed in the
   top of the file.

6. License

   HATE is free software under the GPL v3, see LICENSE file for
